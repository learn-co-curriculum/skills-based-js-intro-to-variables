# JavaScript Variables

## Objectives

1. Explain how variables are tied to their contexts
2. Explain how local and global variables differ

## Introduction

In JavaScript, variables become global when they aren't declared with the `var` keyword. The story is actually a little bit more interesting.

Think of variables as notes on pieces of paper. Local variables are written normally, maybe on a post-it — they're for one person to see. Global variables, contrastingly, are written on billboards in big, bold letters — they're for everyone to see!

Variables in JavaScript have _function-level scope_, meaning that variables are bound to the function context in which they're declared. An example will make what we mean clearer.

``` javascript
function speaker() {
  var sentence = 'Bird is the word.';

  console.log(sentence);
}
```

If we call `speaker()` in console, we'll see `'Bird is the word.'` logged out — all is well. But if we call `console.log(sentence)` outside of the `speaker` function, we'll get an error — the variable `sentence` is _bound_ to the context of the function `speaker`.

If, however, we write

``` javascript
function speaker() {
  sentence = 'Bird is the word.';
}

speaker();
console.log(sentence);
```

and run `speaker()`, we can now call `console.log(sentence)` outside of the `speaker` function because we have declared the variable `sentence` without the `var` keyword — it's now a global variable.

## Same Variable, Different Scopes

Keep in mind too that the same variable name used in different scopes is effectively a different variable. We sometimes refer to repeating a variable name in an inner scope as "shadowing" — it's best to avoid, as you'll quickly see how confusing it can be:

``` javascript
var cuteAnimal = 'quokka';

function makeVariable() {
  var cuteAnimal = 'sugar glider';
  return cuteAnimal;
}

makeVariable();
// 'sugar glider'

cuteAnimal;
// 'quokka'

```

See? Nothing breaks, but if you have a lot of shadowed variables (or even just a lot of space between a variable's initial declaration and its subsequent change(s)), you're gonna have a bad time.

## Changing Variable Values

Local variable assignment can overwrite global variable assignment:

```javascript
volume = 10; //declares a global variable called volume and sets it to 10

function returnEleven() {
  var volume = 11;  //declares a local variable called volume and sets it to 11
  return volume;
}

returnEleven(); // returns 11
volume; // the global variable is still 10

function goToEleven(){
  volume = 11;  //changes the global variable to 11
  return volume;
}

goToEleven(); // returns 11
volume; // the global variable volume has been changed to 11
```

However, global variable assignment can't overwrite local variable assignment, rather it simply reassigns the value of the local variable:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  var greeting = "hola";
  greeting = "hello";
  return greeting;
}

sayHello()
// Returns "hello",
// This demonstrates that the variable greeting is now pointing to the string "hello" instead of "hola"

greeting
// ReferenceError: greeting is not defined
// This demonstrates that the variable greeting is still local instead of global
```
